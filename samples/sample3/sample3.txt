Not the A-hole
last night i 41 f had planned to stay the night at my boyfriend’s place 39 who lives about an hour away from me we went out to watch a band play had a good time and grabbed some food on the way back my bf knows that i’m particular about the bed and i almost always change his bedsheets when i come over because he rarely changes them well last night when i was going to change the bed he wouldn’t let me he had a dirty ripped up fitted sheet that wasn’t even stretched over the entire mattress leaving half of it bare and the side that was covered was full of big holes revealing the dirty mattress underneath i told him there was no way i was sleeping in a bed like that and asked him to let me fix it it would have taken me 3 minutes and he didn’t have to do anything he said the bed was fine; turned out the lights and hopped in i continued to beg him to let me put fresh sheets on and threatened to drive home but he said i was being ridiculous i asked if i could get a blanket to lie on the couch and he threw a dirty stained mattress cover at me and said “use this” so i left and drove all the way home at 2 am we had planned to go to his family’s the next morning but i told him as i was leaving that i wasn’t driving all the way back the next morning he was calling me asking why i wasn’t at his family’s as planned i told him i wasn’t driving all the way back after having to drive home last night he said i was rude for not going to his family’s and is now mad me
