Asshole
i 39m have a daughter who is 20 years old her mother and i were never married and we split up about 6 when my daughter was growing up i had to travel a lot for work and when i was home i usually worked long hours as a result i wasn't as involved in her life as most parents and our relationship has always been strained because of this the traveling and long work weeks ended about 6 years ago when i got a new job shortly after that i met my current wife and we have 2 children together who are 5 and 2 my daughter has never been very fond of my wife and while our relationship has always been rocky after i got married it started to feel like she resented me she's never been particularly interested in spending time together and once my wife came into the picture it got even more difficult to get my daughter to agree to do things together even things as simple as having lunch/dinner together whenever we did manage to arrange something she always asked if my wife was going to be there and eventually asked me to stop inviting her which i did even when it's just the 2 of us though when we meet or talk even over the phone it always comes back to her complaining about her childhood and claiming that i was never around which is false as i did reach out and was as involved as i could be and i've tried to explain the reason to but didn't make a difference to her my daughter has never met either of my younger kids everytime i see or talk to her i ask if she wants to come over and meet then and she dismisses me or changes the subject every time a few months ago for one of my kidsâ€™ birthday she came to my house with a gift bag and just handed it to my wife without saying a word before leaving a few days ago i called my daughter and we ended up getting into an argument over this i told her that my younger kids have a sibling that they've never met and that it wasn't fair to them but she still wouldn't listen to anything i said eventually i told her that i don't want to hear her complain about me not being around much when she was younger since she was doing the same thing to her siblings and she told me it was different because she wasn't their mother i told her that family was family and that she should still at least make an effort and all she said was no before hanging up my wife obviously agrees with me but pretty much everyone else in our lives friends family members etc have been telling me that i was out of line and that the way i treat my daughter is wrong i don't think i was wrong to say it and i can't recall any instance where i've treated my daughter poorly so i'm really just interested in what mutual people have to say aita? edit to clarify the first paragraph: her mother and i split up when she was 6 years old not 6 years ago sorry for the mistype
