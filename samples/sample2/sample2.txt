Everyone Sucks
long story short my cousin and her husband just had their first baby boy and i was invited to the party he threw with his friends as the baby's godfather the husband has been pretty hostile in his manner of speaking towards me ever since they got together but he also helped me whenever i needed it when i asked other family members about it they said that that's just the way he is and i should just suck it up and act similarly towards him as well well the thing is that i'm not that kind of person at all anyway the party goes on and we're pretty drunk and he continues with the hostility so after a while i asked him if he even liked me or not with a serious expression he answered that he didn't like me or my family for that matter i asked back that then why was i even chosen as the godfather to which he didn't reply to say the least i felt my soul crush and tears began rolling down my face he insisted that it was just a joke and to not take it seriously but by then in my drunken state i didn't know whether he was just doing damage control or not after the party was over and everyone went home and it was just the two of us alone i was acting really hostile against him which he noticibly didn't like and shortly after i went home as well when i got home and thought things over i called him to tell him that i'm really sorry about everything and hope that there's no bad blood between us at all he said that it's alright and not to think much of it the next day i went over to him and apologized in person as well to which he was indifferent to now he won't talk to me and won't look me in the eye did i fuck up bad?
